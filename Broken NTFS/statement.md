Someone broke my disk!!
I discovered this command from .bash_history.
```
openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in /tmp/flag.jpg -out /mnt/flag:flag -pass file:<(openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in ./key -pass pass:`pwd`/key -nosalt)
```
Please recover flag from [attachment:problem.7z].

Note: the ntfs.dd is mounted to /mnt.

**[2016/09/03 19:12 JST] The statement is fixedï¼Ž```(-pass pass:`pwd` -> -pass pass:`pwd`/key)```**

Hints:
 1. $MFT is broken
 2. You can determine only one key file used for encrypting.
