If you want `which' to inform you about aliases and shell functions in bash,
then you need to add the following five lines to your $HOME/.bash_profile:

  function which ()
  {
      (alias; declare -f) | /usr/bin/which --tty-only --read-alias --read-functions --show-dot --show-tilde $@
  }
  export -f which

This is the recommended use of this `which'.  Note that the rpm already adds
this to /etc/profile.d; there is no need to add it to $HOME/.bash_profile if
you installed the rpm.

The C shell (csh, tcsh) doesn't have shell functions, but fortunately
inherites aliases in subshells.  To support aliases with a C shell add
the following line to your .profile:

  alias which 'alias | /usr/bin/which --tty-only --read-alias --show-dot --show-tilde'
